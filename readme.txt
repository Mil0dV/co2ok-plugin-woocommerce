Give your customers the choice to make their purchase climate neutral with CO₂ok. 

== Description ==

As awareness about the importance of preserving the environment continues to grow among consumers, companies are increasingly looking for ways to “go green”. Of course, you need to protect your bottom line as well. By enabling your customers to make their purchase climate neutral with CO₂ok, you can do your bit to drive back climate change. CO₂ok lets you increase your conversion with no upfront or recurring costs.

* Improve your corporate image
* Help fight climate change
* Sell more

Help us fight climate change.

How it works
The compensation gets paid to you by the customer. CO₂ok sends a digital invoice at the end of each 3 month term. With the proceeds we support Atmosfair, a certified organisation which produces several CO₂-compensating projects each year.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What changes for my customers? =

Besides the option that the CO2 compensation button provides, nothing changes. Your customers aren't troubled with registration or added steps - they just check out as always, regardless of whether they opted for CO2 compensation or not.

= Privacy considerations =

We gather as little data as possible, specifically:
- the WordPress admin email address, for sending invoices
- limited information about transactions with CO2 compensation selected (orderid, order total and compensation amount)
