Save my planet: offset the CO2-footprint from factory to home

== Description ==

**Save my planet: offset the CO2-footprint from factory to home**

As consumer awareness on the importance of preserving the environment continues to grow, more companies puzzle how to integrate growing demand for CO2 reduction or offset into their business model, ensuring they contribute to a sustainable planet. This is where CO2ok comes in. We empower companies and their customers to neutralise the emission of greenhouse gases, from production to transport.

**Go green**
Get a grip on sustainability of your products, show the impact of production and transport and neutralise CO2 emissions.

**Higher conversion & retention**
Increase shop indexability, brand perception, customer loyalty and value and overall sales, while reducing shopping cart abandonment.

**Easy integration and use**
Our plugin is setup in a matter of minutes. Execute your social responsibility strategy, helping to fight climate change.

CO2ok offers a service that lets your customers compensate the CO2 footprint of their online purchases through investment in projects that directly contribute to lowering or neutralising the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. By enabling your customers to do so you do your bit to preserve our planet for our kids and future generations.

We help online retailers engage with their customers on climate change, offering valuable insight in emissions and the choice to offset it. In turn affiliated retailers build a positive brand image and increase awareness through demonstrated environmental responsibility. As a plus, CO₂ok’s easy to use technology lets you increase your sales conversion.

**Features**
* Multi-language (currently English, Dutch and German - let us know which language you need!)
* Clear information 'hoverbox' with instant explanation
* Flexible placement on the checkout page
* 2 button designs available
* Receive marketing support with our free kit and frequent content updates
* Give your customers a smile on their face with our gifs (or disable them)
* Show the impact your shop makes with our Impact Trustmark and/or Impact Calculator

**How it works**

Upon checkout, customers are presented the choice to offset greenhouse gas emission of their purchase. When clicking the CO2ok-button a minor fee* is added to the order amount. Customers complete their order the regular way. The fee is paid by the customer to you and we bill you the amount of accumulated fees. We then invest in the project(s) of your choice.

Upon clicking the CO2ok-button:
1. We calculate and show the cost to compensate CO2 that was emitted during production and transport of the product.
2. We add the fee to the cart - the checkout process remains unchanged.
3. We bill our retailer for the received compensation fees and invest them in projects via our certified partners: Atmosfair & Fair Climate Fund
4. Your customers shop climate neutral.

*The extra fee is 1% on average.

**Help us fight climate change!**

== Installation ==

Installing our extension takes just a few minutes, for customers, using it is just one click. Nothing about the ordering-process changes. You won’t lose customers by any tedious procedures. If you bump into a problem with the extension, we’re always available through mail, whatsapp or by phone.

This plugin can be installed via:
* [the WordPress plugin installer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Automatic_Plugin_Installation)

Once installed activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What changes for my customers? =

Besides the option that the CO2 compensation button provides, nothing changes. Your customers aren't troubled with registration or added steps - they just check out as always, regardless of whether they opted for CO2 compensation or not.

= Privacy considerations =

We gather as little data as possible, specifically:
- the WordPress admin email address, for sending invoices
- limited information about transactions with CO2 compensation selected (orderid, order total and compensation amount)
