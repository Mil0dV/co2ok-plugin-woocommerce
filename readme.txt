Give your customers the choice to make their purchase climate neutral with CO₂ok. 

== Description ==

CO₂ok empowers companies and their customers in the fight against climate change by offering a service that provides the ability to make purchases climate neutral. We help online retailers create meaningful engagement with their customers by empowering them to choose climate neutrality and communicate this choice - building a positive brand image through demonstrated environmental responsibility.

As awareness about the importance of preserving the environment continues to grow among consumers, companies are increasingly looking for ways to “go green”. Of course, you need to protect your bottom line as well. By enabling your customers to make their purchase climate neutral with CO₂ok, you can do your bit to drive back climate change. CO₂ok lets you increase your conversion with no upfront or recurring costs.

**Account & Pricing**
During installation an account for our service will be created automatically. Use of this service is free of charge. It only takes 1 minute to install the CO₂ok-plugin. When you have integrated the plugin in your webshop, your customers can make their own choice to contribute. That way they make their purchase climate neutral. The minor extra free is on average 2%. For more information, please visit our [FAQ Page](https://co2ok.eco/en/faq/).


**Features**
* Multi-language (currently English, Dutch and German - let us know which language you need!)
* Clear information 'hoverbox' - customers don't need to visit our site for explanation
* Flexible placement on the checkout page
* 2 button designs available

**How it works**

Using our button, shown on the shopping cart and checkout pages, the customer can add a small extra fee (on average 2%), to make their purchase climate neutral.
1. We calculate the cost to compensate the greenhouse gases that are emitted during production and transport of the products - this amount is shown on the button.
2. If the customer chooses to make their purchase CO₂ok, the fee will be added to their cart - the ordering and payment process is unchanged.
3. This amount is used to finance sustainable energy and CO₂-emission reduction projects (via our certified partner, Atmosfair)
4. These projects actively reduce the amount of emitted CO₂. This CO₂ reduction matches the emission of their purchase – thereby making it climate neutral!
The compensation fee gets paid to you by the customer. CO₂ok sends a digital invoice at the end of each 3 month term. With the proceeds we finance CO₂-compensating projects.

**Go green**
As retailer, you naturally try to run your business as sustainably as possible. However, some things are beyond your control – the manufacturing and shipping of your products for example. Manufacturers take too long to become climate neutral. CO₂ok fills this gap and allows your customers to buy everything they want, without contributing to climate change!

**Higher conversion rate, more turnover**
Consumer research has shown that associating your business with a cause not only strengthens your brand, but reduces shopping cart abandonment, increases customer loyalty & lifetime value and increases overall sales. This is also called ‘Cause Marketing’. Additionally, being listed in our partner index will help more environmentally conscious customers find your store.

**Easy integration and use**
Installing our extension takes just a few minutes, for customers, using it is just one click. Nothing about the ordering-process changes. You won’t lose customers by any tedious procedures. If you bump into a problem with the extension, we’re always available through mail or by phone.

**Help us fight climate change!**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What changes for my customers? =

Besides the option that the CO2 compensation button provides, nothing changes. Your customers aren't troubled with registration or added steps - they just check out as always, regardless of whether they opted for CO2 compensation or not.

= Privacy considerations =

We gather as little data as possible, specifically:
- the WordPress admin email address, for sending invoices
- limited information about transactions with CO2 compensation selected (orderid, order total and compensation amount)
