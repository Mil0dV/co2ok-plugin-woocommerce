# WooCommerce Plugin for CO2ok

A WooCommerce plugin to integrate CO2ok

## Installation

Some prose detailing installation

### Gulp & scss

To power up the development process we decided to use gulp for our task
which is currently just converting SCSS to css and minify it.

How to start with gulp and SCSS

SCSS is something on it's own, it's quite close to how css but on steroids
You can more learn about scss [here](https://sass-lang.com/).

To get Gulp working you follow the following steps:

1. Have Node.js and NPM installed on your OS.
2. Open your Terminal
3. Navigate into the plugin directory.
4. run `npm install gulp -g` to install Gulp globally.
5. Run `npm install` in the root folder.
6. after all packages are installed run `gulp`
7. Gulp should be starting now and automatic converting SCSS to css every time a `.scss` file is changed
